# Third Life



### Campaign Rules

* The world is pre-generated with a 1500 block world border (-750 to 750 on the x and z axis)
* There is one enchantment table on the surface at 0x 0z. No further enchantment tables or bookshelves may be crafted
  * Discovered bookshelves and tables may be used
  * Moving the Enchanting Table from its original position is strongly discouraged
* All players start the campaign with a randomly chosen number of lives between 2 and 6
* Lives may be transferred to other players voluntarily using the `/trigger LastLifeGive` command
  * This will give one of your remaining lives to the player closest to you. Be careful, giving away your last life will end your run!
* Each session, a Boogeyman is chosen at random
  * The Boogeymanâ€™s identity is secret. They could be anyone with a green or yellow life
  * The Boogeyman must kill one player with either a green or yellow name in order to be cured
  * If The Boogeyman does not get cured, they fall to 1 life at the start of the next session
  * If you are The Boogeyman, any and all agreements you have with other players are ignored until you are cured. This means you can kill your allies
* Green and Yellow players cannot openly attack other players, unless they are The Boogeyman
  * Green and Yellow players are encouraged to work together to gather resources, build bases, and work to survive the threats that are presented to them
  * Green and Yellow players may retaliate against Red players who attack them, but cannot pursue them if the Red player chooses to run
  * Green and Yellow players may retaliate against The Boogeyman if they are certain the player attacking them is The Boogeyman
  * All players are allowed to set traps, steal resources, and otherwise grief other players as they see fit
* Red players are allowed and encouraged to attack others at will
  * Once you have fallen to your last life, your nametag will turn red. You may choose to abide by the agreements you had before this point, but you are no longer bound by them
  * Your only goal once you are a Red player is to be the last surviving player
* Use of mods that are not part of the official Clovercraft Third Life Modpack is strictly prohibited, with the following exceptions.
  * performance optimization mods such as Lithium, Sodium, and Optifine
  * Shader mods such as Iris and Optifine
  * The Replay Mod for gameplay recording
* All standard rules of the Clovercraft SMP apply to the Clovercraft Third Life server, except where they would conflict with the rules above
