# Getting Started

## Getting Whitelisted

In order to join the Clovercraft Minecraft Java Edition server, you must complete our whitelisting process. In order to get whitelisted, please follow the steps below.

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mpQdPEzjb4)
2. Pick up the roles that best fit you in the #role-select channel
3. Introduce yourself to the server in #introduce-yo-self (see [Introduction Format](getting-started.md#introduction-format))
4. Fill out the whitelist application on our [website](https://clovercraft.gg/join)
5. Wait for a notification from our staff team in the #support channel that you have been added to the whitelist.

### Introduction Format

For introductions, we ask that you please include your name, age, and pronouns. These are required for getting whitelisted on our server. You may also include any other personal information you'd like to share. For example:

> Hey there! My name is Zenfrii, I use he/him pronouns, and I'm 29 years old. Outside of Minecraft I like playing D\&D, tinkering with code, taking photos, and trying to keep my houseplants alive. Looking forward to building with you all!
