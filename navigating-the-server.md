# Navigating the Server

Clovercraft is an open world server with no world border. While this leaves you a vast amount of space to explore, it can also make it pretty easy to get turned around.&#x20;

To help keep players together, we've established a few major cities that you can always get to using their warps. All players are also welcome to set up to 5 of their own home locations to teleport to!

## Major Cities & Warps

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the cities and features below may still be under construction. We'll update this page with new information regularly.
{% endhint %}

### Spawn Island

Teleport: `/warp spawn`

Spawn Island is where your journey on the Clovercraft server will begin. Floating above a small inland sea, Spawn Island features a multi-colored parkour course, a small cottage, and many beautiful decorative features.&#x20;

### Arcadia

Founder: Zenfrii\
Teleport: `/warp arcadia`

Arcadia is our modern city in the Clovercraft world. Featuring towering sky-scrapers, a modern transportation infrastructure, and plenty of free plots to build your own home if you choose to live here!

### Eldershire

Founder: Daisy\
Teleport: `/warp eldershire`

Eldershire is a fantastical city set deep in the heart of a dark oak forest. Featuring a central castle and many cottage-core or fantasy inspired builds, this is a great spot to go if you want to build something a bit more whimsical!

### Noden

Founder: Romy\
Teleport: `/warp noden`

The city below the waves, Noden is a place of unbelievable splendor. It features many public farms, easy access to the surrounding ocean, sea-level building platforms, and a massive floating temple above the city.

## Home Teleports

{% hint style="info" %}
Home teleports are private, which means only you can use them. However, please note that admins can see your home locations and teleport to them if needed.
{% endhint %}

Each member of the Clovercraft server has the ability to set up to five personal teleport locations using the Homes system.

By default, the last bed you slept in is registered as your `/homes bed` location. This is where you will respawn if you die.&#x20;

You can set your primary home location using `/sethome` and return to it from anywhere in the world using `/home`.&#x20;

You can set 4 additional homes, on top of your primary one. To set a secondary home, use the command `/sethome [homename]` without the brackets. You can then return to that location at any time using `/homes [homename]`.

To get rid of a home that you no longer need, you can use `/delhome [homename]`. If you use `/delhome` without specifying a home name, your primary home will be deleted.

## Player to Player Teleportation

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that Admins and Mods do not need to request permission to teleport to your location. In most cases, we still will, but we reserve the right to teleport to your location without request if necessary.
{% endhint %}

All members have the ability to request permission to teleport to another player at any time.&#x20;

To request a teleport, use the command `/tpa [playername]` with the name of the player you'd like to request permission from.

When you receive a teleport request, you will be notified in chat. To accept, simply type `/tpaccept`. If you do not wish to accept, you can safely ignore the request.

If you mistakenly requested teleport permission from another player, you can cancel the request using `/tpacancel`.
