This article is currently a stub, and needs further definition. At this time, please note that while the Survivors server is online, the official season has not started. **A full world reset will occur before the official start of the season.**

### Game Version & Mods

CC Survivors will be run in 1.18.1, as not all mods are updated to 1.18.2 at this time. The following mods are installed on the Survivors server, and are in the available modpack:

* Mouse Wheelie (inventory helper)
* Oh The Biomes You'll Go
* Travelers Backpack
* Trinkets
* Simple Voice Chat

### Modpack Setup

Clovercraft officially supports the MultiMC and Technic launchers for our published modpacks. For instructions on installing MultiMC, please see the [Game Mod Support](game-mod-support/) section of the player guide.

**Using MultiMC**

1. In MultiMC, click "Add Instance"
2. Choose "Import from Zip" in the menu on the left of the New Instance dialogue
3. Name the instance whatever you like (I've named mine "Clovercraft - Survivors")
4. Copy the URL below and paste it into the Import from Zip field\
   `https://clovercraft.gg/modpacks/multimc/Survivors.zip`
5. Click "OK" to create the instance.
6. That's it! You can launch the game by either double-clicking on the instance, or clicking on the "Launch" button with the Clovercraft instance selected.

#### Using Technic

{% hint style="info" %}
The official "Clovercraft Survivors" modpack will be tied to our discord server, and will have a green logo with a red banner.
{% endhint %}

1. Launch the Technic launcher.
2. Select the "Modpacks" tab
3. Search for "Clovercraft Survivors"
4. Install the modpack, and hit "Play!" That's it!

### Accessing The Server

The server is currently live at the ip `thirdlife.clovercraft.gg`. There is no whitelist, so you may log in at any time.
