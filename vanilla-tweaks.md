# Vanilla Tweaks

The Clovercraft server is running several datapacks that make small adjustments to the way the game plays. For the most part, these will just make life easier and stay out of your way, but a couple of them can be used for more advanced purposes.

### Armor Statues

The armor statues datapack allows players to place armorstands in a vast number of different positions, sizes, and orientations. This is mostly useful for decorative purposes. Xisumavoid has a great [explainer video for how to use this datapack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25hSBnM7dM).

### Multi-Player Sleep

Only one player is required to be in bed to pass the night.

### Fast Leaf Decay

Naturally occurring leaves will decay nearly instantly once they are no longer connected to a log.

### Graves

This datapack adds a "grave" item to the game that drops instead of your inventory when you die. You can find this grave after you re-spawn and right-click it to retrieve your inventory.

### Silence Mobs

Using a nametag to name any mob "silence\_me" will stop it from making any noise.

### More Mob Heads / Player Heads

This datapacks make mob head drops more common, and add a player head drop when you're killed by another player.

### Wandering Trades

This datapack adds a variety of decorative mini-blocks to the trades available from Wandering Traders! No more useless llama deliveries.

### Invisible Item Frames

You can convert any item frame or glow item frame to an invisible item frame by placing it in an anvil and renaming it to "Invisible." Invisible item frames work the same way that a normal item frame would, but once you place the item in them, the frame disappears!

{% hint style="warning" %}
"Invisible" is case sensitive. Make sure you capitalize the first I when renaming the item.
