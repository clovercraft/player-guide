The SMP IP is **mc.clovercraft.gg**

### Server Rules

The following rules apply to both our Discord and Minecraft servers. Violation of any of the following rules is grounds for the staff team to kick you from the server. Repeat offenders will be banned.

* Racism, transphobia, homophobia, and overall harassment will not be tolerated.
* You must be 18+
* Bullying and generally mean comments are a no go. Teasing is okay but remember: Harassment is defined by the harassed.
* No NSFW content. Cursing and joking are allowed, but be mindful of peoples comfort.
* No loli or gore content on either server will be allowed.
* Introduce yourself before interacting with the rest of the server
* Have fun and make friends!

### Minecraft Specific Rules

* Respect others builds and items.
* Do not take from chests you do not own unless the chest is explicitly marked for public use
* Griefing will not be tolerated. Pranks are allowed, but only with the ongoing consent of everyone involved.
* Please do your best to minimize your lag impact. If you plan on building massive farms or doing extremely technical builds, contact our staff team before hand to make sure it won't cause any issues.
* No hacking / X-Ray / other tools that give you a substantial advantage over a vanilla player in the world.
* Rule of Immersion: In general, you can break pretty much any block in Minecraft. However, that doesn't always mean you should. When interacting with builds you did not construct, try to treat them as real buildings and interact with them the way you would a part of an RPG world. To put it simply; Yes, you _can_ pickaxe that iron door, but you probably shouldn't.
