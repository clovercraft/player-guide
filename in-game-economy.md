# In-Game Economy

Clovercraft has an in-game economy that functions separately from normal villager trading. Each player starts in the world with 500.00â˜­ **** available to them.

Players can spend money at villager shops, send money to each other directly, and earn money by selling goods to the banker.

Players are also welcome to open up their own player shops to sell items to other server members!

## Essential Commands

| Command                  | Description                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `/bal`                   | Check your balance           |
| `/baltop`                | See who has the most money   |
| `/pay [amount] [player]` | Send money to another player |
| `/vm move`               | Move a villager market       |

## Earning Money

The easiest way to earn money is to sell items to the Banker, located at The Capitol building near spawn. The banker buys various raw ores and minerals in exchange for their cash value. Each player has a maximum amount of material they can sell to the banker for the day.

You can also earn money by offering to complete tasks for other players, or by selling materials to other players.

## Villager Market Shops

Clovercraft uses the [Villager Market](https://vebjorn-elvekrok.gitbook.io/villager-market/) plugin to allow for easier trade between players. Simple use instructions are available here, but you can view the plugin wiki for a detailed guide.

### Setting Up Shop

All players are welcome to open up their own shops to sell and buy items. In order to open a shop, visit the Capitol and go inside the main building. Shop Registration is just inside in the East wing, right behind the banker.

Shops come in multiple different sizes, which have different costs and purchase limits. While you can purchase up to 25 shops in total, we generally recommend limiting this to a small number to help keep lag down and keep from having your business empire become somewhat unmanageable.&#x20;

#### Shop Sizes

| Shop Size | Storefront Slots | Storage Slots |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Small     | 8                | 27            |
| Medium    | 17               | 54            |
| Large     | 54               | Infinite      |

Once you've purchased your spawn egg, find the location you want to place your shop. You are welcome to set up shop wherever you like, but if you chose a space that is central to a public area we may ask you to move your shop. We recommend building a small storefront for your villager.

To spawn your shop, stand where you want your villager and use (right-click) the ground with the egg. This will spawn your shopkeeper. You can edit your storefront by right-clicking on the villager. Detailed instructions for using the shop owner GUI are available on the [plugin wiki](https://vebjorn-elvekrok.gitbook.io/villager-market/edit-shop/shop-front).

Any profits from your villager market shops will automatically be deposited into your account balance.

### Shopping

For visitors, villager market shops function almost identically to standard villager trades. The price and number of items being exchanged can be viewed by hovering over items in the storefront, and items can be purchased by simply clicking on them. You can only purchase items if you have enough money in your player account. Some shops (like our banker) even purchase items from players, which provides another way to make money.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Purchasing from shops can cause a small amount of client lag. If you don't immediately see the purchase you made, wait a few seconds before attempting the purchase again to make sure you don't double up! Clovercraft does not guarantee purchases or sales on the server.
