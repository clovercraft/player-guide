# Game Mod Support

Clovercraft runs a PaperMC server, which means you can play on our SMP with a standard vanilla version of the game.

If you would like to run client-side mods for quality of life or improved performance, you are more than welcome to do so! We even offer our own official modpack that you can run using [MultiMC](https://multimc.og). There are installation instructions for our MultiMC instance below.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Mods that enable x-ray or other cheats will result in the player running them getting banned from the server.
{% endhint %}

## Clovercraft Quality-of-Life Modpack

The Clovercraft Quality-of-Life modpack adds a small number of mods to the vanilla game to make playing on our server even better. Navigate the world using both a world map and mini-map, set custom location markers, and even make use of our in-game proximity voice chat!

The Quality-of-Life modpack runs on Fabric, and includes the following mods:

* Fabric API - essential for running fabric mods
* Mouse Wheelie - adds a variety of useful buttons and key combos for managing your inventory
* Shulker Box Tooltips - hold `shift` to see what's in shulkers in your inventory
* Simple Voice Chat - Our server-supported proximity voice chat
* Xaero's Minimap - A highly configurable mini-map with entity radar
* Xaero's World Map - A worldmap that pairs wonderfully with the mini-map

### Installing the Modpack
